## Shortcuts
Shortcuts that I use on a daily basis.

If you search for something specific that are not in this list, see the [cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/).

- `Ctrl` + `B`, `$`: rename the current window within tmux.
- `Ctrl` + `B`, `s`: show all session. Allows me to preview my sessions and quickly navigate through.
