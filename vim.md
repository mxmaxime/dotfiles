## Shortcut
That I don't want to forget and could be useful to you.

- Refresh NERDTree listing: focus nerdtree and type `r` *(you created a new file/folder and it does not appear, refresh!).*
- Refresh ctrl-p listing: display it and type `F5` *(you created a new file/folder and it does not appear, refresh!).*. [Source.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8663886/6555414)
