## Shortcut
That I don't want to forget and could be useful to you.

- Refresh NERDTree listing: focus nerdtree and type `r` *(you created a new file/folder and it does not appear, refresh!).*
- Refresh ctrl-p listing: display it and type `F5` *(you created a new file/folder and it does not appear, refresh!).*. [Source.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8663886/6555414)

## Search
I used the fantastic fzf with [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) plugin.
- You have to install fzf on your computer.
- You have to install `the_silver_searcher` if you use the `Ag` command (that I heavily use and love).

## Splits
### Close
From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4809729/cancel-split-window-in-vim
- `Control` + `w`, then hit `q` to close a window (the selected one).
- `:on`: To close all splits, I usually place the cursor in the window that shall be the on-ly visible one and then do :on which makes the current window the on-ly visible window. Nice mnemonic to remember.
